# Normally, it does not matter in which filename a particular symbol is
# defined. Only in cases where a file defines an anonymous tag type (struct,
# union, enum), its name is included in the resulting library.  In this
# particular case, it would not be necessary though since none of the exported
# symbols actually refers to one of these anonymous types.
