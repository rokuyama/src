.Sh DESCRIPTION
The

file overrides various parameters used during the build of the system.
.Pp
Listed below are the
.Nm
variables that may be set, the values to which each may be set,
a brief description of what each variable does, and a reference to
relevant manual pages.
.
.Ss NetBSD System variables
.

.DFLT
Unset.

.de DFLTy
.DFLT
.Dq yes

Forced to
.Dq no
if

is defined,
usually in the Makefile before any
.Xr make 1
.Cm \&.include
directives.

if
.Sy \\$* .
..
.de YorN
Can be set to

.
.Bl -tag -width 15n
.
.\" These entries are sorted alphabetically
.
.It Sy BSDOBJDIR
The real path to the object directory tree for the
.Nx
source tree.
.DFLT
.Dq Pa /usr/obj
.
.It Sy BSDSRCDIR
The real path to the
.Nx
source tree, if
.Sy NETBSDSRCDIR
isn't defined.
.DFLT
.Dq Pa /usr/src
.
.It Sy BUILD
If defined,
.Sq "make install"
checks that the targets in the source directories are up-to-date and
re-makes them if they are out of date, instead of blindly trying to install
out of date or non-existent targets.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy BUILDID
Identifier for the build.
The identifier will be appended to
object directory names, and can be consulted in the
.Xr make 1
configuration file in order to set additional build parameters,
such as compiler flags.
.DFLTu
.
.It Sy COPTS
Extra options for the C compiler.
Should be appended to (e.g.,
.Sy COPTS+=-g ) ,
rather than explicitly set.
Note that
.Sy CPUFLAGS ,
not
.Sy COPTS ,
should be used for
compiler flags that select CPU-related options.
Also note that
.Sy CFLAGS
should never be set in
.Nm .
.
.It Sy CPUFLAGS
Additional flags passed to the compiler/assembler to select
CPU instruction set options, CPU tuning options, etc.
Such options should not be specified in
.Sy COPTS ,
because some parts of the build process need to override
CPU-related compiler options.
.
.It Sy DESTDIR
Directory to contain the built
.Nx
system.
If set, special options are passed to the compilation tools to
prevent their default use of the host system's
.Sy /usr/include , /usr/lib ,
and so forth.
This pathname should
.Em not
end with a slash
.Pq /
character (for installation into the system's root directory, set
.Sy DESTDIR
to an empty string).
The directory must reside on a file system which supports long file
names and hard links.
.Pp
.Em Note :
.Sy build.sh
will provide a default of
.Dq Pa destdir . Ns Sy MACHINE
(in the top-level
.Sy .OBJDIR )
unless run in
.Sq expert
mode
.DFLT
Empty string if
.Sy USETOOLS=yes ;
unset otherwise.
.
.It Sy EXTSRCSRCDIR
Obsolete.
.
.It Sy KERNEL_DIR Pq No experimental
.YorN
Indicates if a top-level directory
.Sy /netbsd/
is created.
If
.Dq yes ,
the directory will contain a kernel file
.Pa /netbsd/kernel
and a corresponding modules directory
.Pa /netbsd/modules/ .
System bootstrap procedures will be modified to search for the kernel
and modules in the
.Pa /netbsd/
directory.
This is intended to simplify system upgrade and rollback procedures by
keeping the kernel and its associated modules together in one place.
.Pp
If
.Dq no ,
the kernel file will be stored in
.Pa /netbsd
and the modules will be stored within the
.Pa /stand/${ARCH}/
directory hierarchy.
.Pp
The
.Sy KERNEL_DIR
option is a work-in-progress, and is highly experimental.
It is also subject to change without notice.
.DFLTn
.It Sy MAKEVERBOSE

Supported values:
.Bl -tag -width 2n
.It 0
No descriptive messages or commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are shown.

Brief messages are shown describing what is being done,
but the actual commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are not displayed.
.It 2
Descriptive messages are shown as above (prefixed with a
.Sq # ) ,
and ordinary commands performed by
.Xr make 1
are displayed.
.It 3
In addition to the above, all commands performed by
.Xr make 1
are displayed, even if they would ordinarily have been hidden
through use of the
.Dq \&@
prefix in the relevant makefile.
.It 4
In addition to the above, commands executed by
.Xr make 1
are traced through use of the
.Xr sh 1
.Dq Fl x
flag.
