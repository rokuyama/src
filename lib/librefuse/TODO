To Do
=====
address all XXX
implement proper lookup (pending some libpuffs stuff)
support fuse_mt (i.e. worker threads, but that'll probably be smarter
		 to do inside of libpuffs)
support fuse_ll (i.e. "raw" vfs/vnode export)
implement all sorts of compat tweaks to appease various file systems
do proper implementations of dirfillers
statfs - some fuse file systems want struct statfs and we only have
         statvfs available natively
Support polling appeared on FUSE 2.8 (struct fuse_pollhandle).
Support data buffers appeared on FUSE 2.9 (struct fuse_buf).

Done
====
statvfs
sync
WARNS=4
